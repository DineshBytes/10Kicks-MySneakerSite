## 👟 What is 10KICKS?

10KICKS is a single-page sneaker e-commerce application built to feel premium — the kind of shopping experience you'd expect from a flagship brand store. It was built as a 3-person academic project, and this repository reflects a **complete personal redesign** of the entire home page, UI system, animation architecture, and user experience by **Dinesh**.

Every scroll effect, every glassmorphism card, every neon glow, every animated brand carousel — rebuilt from scratch.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Structure | HTML5 |
| Styling & Animations | CSS3 — Custom properties, keyframes, transforms |
| Logic & State | Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) |
| Responsiveness | Bootstrap 4.5.2 (grid & utilities) |
| Typography | Google Fonts |

> **Zero frontend frameworks.** This project demonstrates full control over the DOM, rendering pipeline, and animation system — without React, Vue, or any abstraction layer.

## ⚡ Animation & Performance Philosophy

All animations follow GPU-friendly rules — only `transform` and `opacity` are animated, never layout-triggering properties like `width`, `height`, or `top`.

```
✅ transform: translateY() scale() rotate()   →  GPU composited
✅ opacity                                    →  GPU composited
❌ width / height / top / left / margin       →  Triggers layout reflow
```

This keeps the frame rate smooth even on mid-range devices.

## 👥 Team

This project was built collaboratively by 3 members.

---

### 🟢 Dinesh *(this repo)*
Took ownership of the **entire home page** and rebuilt it from the ground up. Designed and implemented the glassmorphism UI system, hero carousel with brand-specific animations, neon glow effects, custom cursor, staggered card transitions, depth layering, and the overall visual identity of the site. Every animation, every shadow, every interaction on the home page — that's this guy.

> This is **Dinesh's version of the project** — independently pushed with a complete redesign of the entire home page, animation system, and visual identity.

---

### 🟡 Jaswanth
Handled brand category design and worked on maintaining visual consistency across the different sections of the site.

---

### 🔴 Irfan
Built the core skeleton of the project — landing page structure, navigation system, and the initial product card layout that the rest of the team built on top of.
